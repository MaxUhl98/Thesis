# Thesis Experiments
In this repository, you will find all experiments related to my thesis on:

**Optimization Techniques for LLM Inference: Quantitative Analysis of Knowledge Distillation, Batching, and Quantization**

> Note: Experiments requiring internal company data are excluded.

### Distillation Experiments
The distillation experiments require model checkpoints, which are too large to be hosted on Git.  
If you're interested in accessing them, feel free to email me at **professional.max.uhl@gmail.com**.

### Pretraining Datasets
The datasets used for pretraining are also too large to upload.  
Please contact me via email if you'd like access to these as well.

### Requirements
All experiments, *except for the German model pretraining* can be run using only the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
