# Thesis Experiments
In this repository you will find all experiments excluding the ones requiring internal company data for my thesis on the topic of
**Optimization Techniques for LLM Inference: Quantitative Analysis of Knowledge Distillation, Batching and Quantization**.

For the distillation experiments you will require the model checkpoints, which are too large to be uploaded for git, if you are interested you can email me for the weights at professional.max.uhl@gmail.com

All experiments except the german model pretraining can be run with just the requirements in the sources directory.
